### Hey, I'm Aleksa 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Windsor (Software Engineering specialization) who loves building practical tools across full-stack, data, and ML. I’ve worked on everything from battery fault-detection models and medical imaging anonymization to full-stack web apps and 3D games. On GitHub, I turn real-world problems into production-ready code and clean documentation. Always learning, always shipping. 🚀
